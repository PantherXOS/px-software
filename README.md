# PantherX Software Application

## Introduction

We introduce _Software Application_ as an easy to use interface provided for users to search and install softwares on PantherX. Users can search through all or specific _categories_  for a package, and could see package details and install it on their machine. they are also be able to update/remove already installed applications in their profile.

## Internal Implementation

```

_Software Application_ consist of following internal components:

1. _Interface Handler_, which is responsible for receiving user requests and provide proper response for them.
2. _Package Manager Interface_, which is responsible for translating user received requests to _Package Manager_ specific commands, execute them, and return back proper response to _User Interface_.

### Interface Handler

This component receive user commands from Interface and perform proper actions based on them. some of actions that need to be handled are:

#### 1. Category List

Grid View list of categories including _Title_, _Icon_ and _Short Description_.

![Category List](docs/sketch/category-list.png)

#### 2. Package List

List View for packages including _Title_, _Icon_, _Category_ and _Short Description_.  this pages could be used to show list of packages inside a category or list of packages matching a search criteria.

#### 3. Provide *Details* of a specific package

Details View for a specific package including all available information about the package.

### Package Manager Interface

This component is responsible for receiving requests from interface and translate them to _Package Manager Specific_ commands, execute generated commands and transform results to the format that User interface understands.

Here is a list of _Package Manager Interface_ tasks:

1. Update Package Repositories
2. Provide List of installed Packages
3. Install New Package
4. Update Specific Package / List of Packages / All available updates
5. Remove already installed package
6. Search Packages based on specific criteria
7. Provide package details

#### 1. Update Package Repositories

_Package Manager Interface_ need to have an interface that allows user to update list of package repositories manually. in _Guix_ we use `guix pull` command to perform this task.

#### 2. Provide List of installed Packages

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to have an interface to allow user interface to get list of installed packages. in _Guix_ we use `guix package --list-installed` command for this propose.

#### 3. Install New Package

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to have an interface to allow user interface to request for installing a new package. in _Guix_ we use `guix package install ...` command for this propose.

#### 4. Update Specific Package / List of Packages / All available updates

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to have an interface to update specific package, a list of packages or all packages installed in user profile. in _Guix_ we could update a package or list of packages by re-installing them. we could also update all available updates in user profile by using `guix package -u` command.

#### 5. Remove already installed package

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to have an interface to allow user interface to remove a package from user profile. in _Guix_ we use `guix package -r ...` command for this purpose.

#### 6. Search Packages based on specific criteria

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to provide an interface to allow user interface to get list of packages based on provided search criteria. search operation could be performed on a specific category or search for packages that contain specific keyword inside.

#### 7. Provide package details

_Package Manager Interface_ needs to have an interface to allow user interface to get details for a specific package.

## Database
The Database of `PackageManager` is based on `recutils`. 

* The information of packages will be retrieved via `recsel` from Package Repo. (One `recfile` will be generated for each package)
* The `recfiles` will be store in PantherX Package Repo. 
* The `px-software` read the `recfiles` with `librec` in C.
* The `DB` will be check at first of each running via dowbloading a `meta` file from `https://assets.software.pantherx.org/px-software-assets_latest_meta.yaml`.
  - Download latest `meta` file.
  - Compare the installed `hash` with latest `hash`.
  - Download latest archive file from `https://assets.software.pantherx.org/px-software-assets_latest.tgz` and install in `~/.cache/px-software-assets`, if update is available.

### URL scheme
`px-software` could be run by `px-software:...` url for openning specific list or specific application page.
```
px-software:list=user_updates
```
```
px-software:app=featherpad
```

## Update Check Guile Script

We're using the `px-software-update-check` guile script for retrieving the user/system upgradable package list. [here](https://git.pantherx.org/development/applications/px-software/-/tree/master/script)

* getting the user upgradable package list:
```bash
$ px-software-update-check
```

* getting the system upgradable package list:
```bash
$ px-software-update-check system
```

The output data structure is:
```
package_name:old_version>new_version
```


Example:
```bash
gnutls:3.6.9>3.6.A
eudev:3.2.9>3.2.9-1
guile:2.2.6>2.2.7
guix:1.0.1-15.a941cec>1.0.1-15.a941cec
```
